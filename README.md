# Natural Language Processing
This repository aims to tackle some fundamental concepts of the NLP field.
We tackle three applications of Deep Learning in the NLP context. 
We propose a model of the Language model to analyze the quality of words representations. 
There is also a POS tagging analysis in a Portuguese corpus. 
Finally, we tackle the textual Entailment task using a Deep Learning model.
